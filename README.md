# Python-Platformer
A basic platformer made in python!
You need the pygame graphic interface to play the game.
Should scale to fit all monitors!
For those of you who don't know how to use python, open the file in python IDLE and press f5 or Run => Run Module.

To install python IDLE, visit 45.55.99.72 (python.org) - downloads page.
To install pygame, visit 104.36.12.138 (pygame.org) - The code under the getting started tab goes in powershell in Windows or Terminal in Mac OS or Linux.

Version 6:
Added level 6!
Background for levels 6-10 will be green!
The goal is now blue!
There is a new platform: An orange one that bounces you and allows you to jump once in midair!

Version 5.1:
First test on Windows!
Fixed font problems!
For scaling issues, make sure you divide the resolution by the OS's scale (for example, if it is 150%, you need to multiply by 2/3.
The framerate is now limited to 60 FPS, so it won't be too fast to play!

Version 5:
A fifth level!
The player graphics have been updated!
There is a pause function!
Gravity is now the same for all monitors!

Version 4:
A fourth level!
There is now a way to kill enemies!
There is BGM, made with FamiTracker!
Ready screen looks better!

Version 3:
A third, nearly impossible level!
Please don't make an issue about level 3 being too hard, I did it in 43 seconds on my first try.
There is an enemy in level 3 that makes you reset the level!
Removed an extra print command from version 2!

Version 2:
A second, more challenging level!
There is a Ready screen before each level starts!
The timer continues into level 2 where it stopped in level 1!
It will create a file to save your resolution data to so you don't have to look it up!
The file is called Resolution.txt and is created if you say you haven't played before.
You need 4 files for it to run: platformer.py, platformer_lvl1.py, platformer_lvl2.py, and Ready_screen.py.

More updates coming soon, including more enemies, more levels, powerups, and SFX!
